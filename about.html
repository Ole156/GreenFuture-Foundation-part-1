    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      GreenFuture Foundation is a non-profit organization committed to
      promoting sustainability, protecting the environment, and empowering
      communities. Founded in 2015, we started as a small group of volunteers
      planting trees in local neighborhoods. Over the years, we’ve grown into
      a recognized foundation working on projects across renewable energy,
      conservation, and waste reduction.

    <p>
      <strong>Our Mission:</strong> To create a greener, cleaner, and healthier
      world through action, awareness, and education.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Our Vision:</strong> A future where every community thrives in
      harmony with nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      We partner with schools, local businesses, and global environmental
      networks to expand our reach and maximize impact.
